# TSGen

Creates the required files for Thunderstore migration. Indented use is for H3VR, but can be forked easily for other applications.

This program aims to deal with the biggest problem in Thunderstore migration: creating correct compatible files for uploading.

## Usage
After installation, run the `TSGen.exe` file. A command window should appear:

Simply fill out what it requires and it will create a folder inside of wherever you extracted `TSGen.exe` to named after your mod with the manifest, icon, and readme file containing the bare minimum to upload to Thunderstore. 

**Note:** When uploaded to Thunderstore, make sure to name your `.zip` upload `[authorname]-[modname].zip`. Here is an example: `nayr31-NToolbox.zip`

## Installation:
Extract the `.zip` release file into a folder somewhere on your computer so that the `TSGen.exe` file is outside of a `.zip`.
```
C:/
    Users/
        Me/
            Documents/
                TSGen/
                    TSGen.exe
```
